"""Solve MCP leaf provides Fluent solver live-context and execution tools.

This module physically hosts the :class:`SolveMCP` class. The parent
package ``ansys.fluent.mcp.solve`` re-exports the class so both
import paths (``from ansys.fluent.mcp.solve import SolveMCP`` and
``from ansys.fluent.mcp.solve.mcp import SolveMCP``) resolve to the
same class. This subpackage is the entire MCP-only surface. The
agent loop, planner, and recipes are not part of this package.

This open-source leaf ships only the PyFluent backend. It always
connects to PyFluent for code execution and live-model introspection.
Additional backends (such as the internal Fluids One managed-service ``fluids_one_solve``
backend) are contributed by other installed packages through the
``ansys.fluent.mcp.solve_backends`` entry-point group and merged into
the backend registry at construction time.

Usage::

    connect()  # launch / attach PyFluent
    connect(ip="...", port=12345)  # attach to a remote solver
    run_code(code)  # always executed via PyFluent
