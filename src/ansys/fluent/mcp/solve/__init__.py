"""Solve leaf, which is Fluent solver's code generation and live-context tools.

The MCP class :class:`SolveMCP` lives in
:mod:`ansys.fluent.mcp.solve.mcp`; it is re-exported here so both
``ansys.fluent.mcp.solve`` and ``ansys.fluent.mcp.solve.mcp`` resolve
to the same class. New code may prefer the direct import for
explicitness.

The product-domain layer is organised into subpackages:
:mod:`~ansys.fluent.mcp.solve.backends` (PyFluent / composite
backends), :mod:`~ansys.fluent.mcp.solve.catalog` (offline schema,
index, help, retriever), :mod:`~ansys.fluent.mcp.solve.lib` (domain
tools, units, patterns) and :mod:`~ansys.fluent.mcp.solve.data`
(bundled settings schema).
