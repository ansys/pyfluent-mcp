r"""Docstring extractor for PyFluent's generated ``settings_<version>.py``.

The bundled ``api_objects.json`` carries only ``(path, kind)`` tuples,
which is fine for exact-path lookup but useless for natural-language
queries such as *"temperature of incoming gas"*. The relevant leaf is
spelled ``velocity_inlet.thermal.t``, and the token ``t`` does not match
any English word.

PyFluent does, however, ship a one-paragraph class docstring with every
generated settings class. Indexing those docstrings into the lexical
fallback closes most of the recall gap to an embedding-based retriever
without adding a vector store.

This module extracts ``leaf_python_name -> docstring`` from the
generated module **by regex**. Importing the 3.4 MB module is slow and
has side effects unwanted at retrieval time. The parsed map is
cached to disk so the regex is paid once per (PyFluent version,
ansys-fluent-mcp version) combination.

Multiple classes can share a leaf name. For example, ``temperature`` appears as
a child of ``wall``, ``mass_flow_inlet``, ``radiator``, and more. The map
stores the deduplicated union of all docstrings for a given leaf,
joined by ``\\n\\n``. The lexical scorer then tokenizes that blob and
uses it as additional bag-of-words evidence for any path whose leaf
matches.

This is approximate. A query that hits via the ``wall``-specific
docstring may also boost ``radiator``-rooted paths sharing the leaf.
That's an acceptable trade for the cost (~50 LOC, no extra dependency)
because the eventual ranker still prefers paths whose path tokens
overlap the query. The docstring evidence is additive, not decisive.
