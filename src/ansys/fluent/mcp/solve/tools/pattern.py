"""Wildcard/pattern helpers for named-object selection.

PyFluent accepts glob-style patterns on string indexers and string-list
properties (such as ``cell_zone_conditions.copy(from_="cell_1", to="cell_*")``
and ``zone_assignment.passive_zone = "*bar*|*tabzone*"``). The solver itself
expands these patterns at runtime. This module mirrors that contract on
the *client* side to do the following:

* Recognize a pattern in user-supplied/LLM-generated identifiers.
* Validate a pattern by checking that it matches at least one live name.
* Enumerate matching names for batched (multi-edit) plan steps.

The pattern grammar is a subset of PyFluent's:

* ``*``: Match any run of characters (``fnmatch`` semantics).
* ``?``: Match a single character.
* ``[abc]``: Character class.
* ``|``: Alternation between sub-patterns. For example,
  ``"wall-*|inlet-?"`` matches either branch.

Plain identifiers (no wildcard metacharacters) are returned by
:func:`expand_pattern` unchanged when they appear in ``candidates``,
so a literal name behaves as a direct lookup.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Name of the object, module, or setting being processed.

    -------
    bool
        Boolean result produced by the function.

def expand_pattern(pattern: str, candidates: Iterable[str]) -> list[str]:

    The result preserves the order in which candidates first match, so
    callers get a stable enumeration that mirrors the underlying live
    name list. Duplicate matches (possible across alternation branches)
    are collapsed.

    Plain (non-pattern) ``pattern`` values fall through to a literal
    membership check, returning ``[pattern]`` if present and ``[]``
    otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pattern : str
        Selection pattern for matching object names.
    candidates : Iterable[str]
        Candidates to supply to the function.

    Returns
    -------
